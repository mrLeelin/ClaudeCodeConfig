I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore this Unity project codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see you're working on the JellybeanUnity project on the `dev` branch. I notice:\n\n- This is a Unity project with an AI plugin (Coplay) recently imported\n- Recent work involves animation system modifications\n- The project uses Easy Save 3 for data persistence\n- There's a new Launcher scene that hasn't been committed yet\n\nI'm in **read-only planning mode**, which means I can:\n- ✅ Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, Read, and Bash (read-only operations)\n- ✅ Understand your project structure and patterns\n- ✅ Design detailed implementation plans\n- ✅ Identify critical files for implementation\n\nI **cannot**:\n- ❌ Create, modify, or delete any files\n- ❌ Run commands that change system state\n- ❌ Install packages or dependencies\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan or explore? For example:\n- Analyze the new animation system implementation\n- Design a plan for integrating new features\n- Review the Coplay AI plugin structure\n- Plan improvements to the launcher system\n\nJust share your requirements and any perspective you'd like me to take, and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1273,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":1273},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"0f431024-8207-4705-bae1-4c3a496e32a3","timestamp":"2025-12-16T03:18:20.435Z"}
