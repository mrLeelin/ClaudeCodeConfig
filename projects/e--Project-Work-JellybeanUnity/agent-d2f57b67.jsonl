I can see this is a Unity project called \"JellybeanUnity\" with:\n\n- A recent AI plugin import\n- Animation work being done\n- Some Coplay package integration\n- Easy Save 3 plugin\n\nBefore we dive into any specific requirements, let me explore the project structure to get oriented:\n\n<bash>\nls -la e:/Project/Work/JellybeanUnity/JellybeanUnity\n</bash>\n\n<bash>\nfind e:/Project/Work/JellybeanUnity/JellybeanUnity -name \"*.sln\" -o -name \"*.csproj\" | head -20\n</bash>\n\n<bash>\nls -la e:/Project/Work/JellybeanUnity/JellybeanUnity/Assets\n</bash>\n\nI'm warmed up and ready! I understand that I'm in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can explore the codebase using:\n- Read, Glob, Grep to examine files\n- Bash for read-only operations (ls, find, cat, git commands, etc.)\n\nBut I **CANNOT**:\n- Create, edit, or delete files\n- Use Write, Edit, or any file modification tools\n- Run commands that change system state\n\nWhat requirements would you like me to help design an implementation plan for? Please provide:\n1. The specific requirements or feature you want implemented\n2. (Optional) Any particular perspective or approach you'd like me to take\n\nI'll then explore the codebase thoroughly and create a detailed implementation plan for you!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1273,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1273,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":381,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"0e953590-a3fe-49a6-91fb-151bc99fc311","timestamp":"2025-12-16T03:18:20.907Z"}
