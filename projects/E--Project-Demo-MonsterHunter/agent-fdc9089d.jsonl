I'm Claude Code, operating in **READ-ONLY planning mode**. I can explore the codebase and design implementation plans, but I am **strictly prohibited** from modifying, creating, or deleting any files.\n\nI've reviewed the project instructions for the MonsterHunter Unity action game. I understand:\n\n## Key Architecture\n- **ActionMachine**: Core state machine with priority-based transitions\n- **Kcc**: Custom kinematic character controller with Manual/Auto update modes\n- **Handler System**: Factory pattern with attribute-based registration\n- **Update Loop**: Separated LogicUpdate (game logic) and RenderUpdate (visuals)\n\n## Critical Systems\n- `GameManager` → `ActionController` → `ActionMachine` + `Animancer` + `Kcc`\n- Handler lifecycle: Initialize → Instantiate → Enter → Updates → Exit → Dispose\n- Priority system for state interruption\n\n## Configuration\n- JSON-based action configs in `Assets/_Game/Assets/Settings/NBC/`\n- Luban system for config management via `LocalModelManager`\n\nI'm ready to explore the codebase and design implementation plans based on requirements you provide. I will:\n1. Use Read, Glob, Grep, and read-only Bash commands to explore\n2. Design solutions following the existing architecture\n3. Provide detailed implementation plans\n4. List critical files for implementation\n\nWhat requirements would you like me to analyze and design an implementation plan for?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":3453,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":330,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"48acb222-989d-4eb0-bdae-81acf509a322","timestamp":"2025-12-16T06:36:03.529Z"}
