Please provide:\n1. The specific feature or improvement you want to implement\n2. Any particular perspective or approach you'd like me to take (architectural, performance, maintainability, etc.)\n\nI'll then thoroughly explore the relevant codebase areas and create a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5105,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5105,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":280,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"73a4ef5a-6ed8-497b-8956-fe19dce1e8b2","timestamp":"2025-12-22T09:31:23.371Z"}
