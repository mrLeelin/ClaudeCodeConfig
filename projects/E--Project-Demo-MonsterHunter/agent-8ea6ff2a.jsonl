I can see this is an action game built around a custom ActionMachine system with Animancer for animations and a custom Kinematic Character Controller (Kcc).\n\nI understand that I'm in **READ-ONLY planning mode** - I can explore the codebase and design implementation plans, but I cannot create, modify, or delete any files.\n\nBased on the project overview, I can help you with:\n\n1. **Architecture Analysis**: Understanding the state machine, handler factory pattern, and component composition\n2. **System Design**: Planning new features like clip types, tracks, or handlers\n3. **Code Exploration**: Finding patterns in existing handlers, understanding the update loop architecture\n4. **Integration Planning**: Designing how new systems would integrate with ActionMachine, Kcc, or Animancer\n\nWhat would you like me to help you plan or explore? For example:\n- Designing a new clip type or handler\n- Planning improvements to the state machine\n- Understanding how to add new character actions\n- Exploring the movement system integration\n- Analyzing the configuration loading system\n\nPlease share your requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to take in the design process."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":3453,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":269,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"4fb04cf9-9e5e-42b3-8726-00f8eb2152d5","timestamp":"2025-12-16T06:36:11.728Z"}
