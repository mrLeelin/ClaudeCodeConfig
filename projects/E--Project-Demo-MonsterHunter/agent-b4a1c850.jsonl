This is a Unity action game project called **MonsterHunter** with a custom ActionMachine system for managing character actions and skills. \n\nKey points I've noted:\n- Uses a hierarchical architecture: GameManager → ActionController → ActionMachine\n- Core systems: ActionMachine (state machine), Kcc (movement controller), AnimancerComponent (animation)\n- Handler Factory Pattern with attribute-based registration\n- Data-driven design using JSON configuration files\n- Custom update loop architecture separating LogicUpdate and RenderUpdate\n- Supports priority-based state transitions\n\nI'm ready to help you search, navigate, and analyze the codebase. I can:\n- Find files using glob patterns and grep searches\n- Read and analyze code implementations\n- Locate specific classes, methods, or configurations\n- Explore the project structure and dependencies\n\nWhat would you like me to search for or investigate in the MonsterHunter codebase?"}],"model":"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001","stop_reason":"end_turn","usage":{"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0},"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"input_tokens":3326,"output_tokens":214,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"1f31a202-f0f3-4069-833c-c1ce47c257cf","timestamp":"2025-12-16T06:35:47.434Z"}
