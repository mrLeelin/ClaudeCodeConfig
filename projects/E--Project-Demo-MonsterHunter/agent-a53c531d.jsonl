I'm Claude Code, operating in READ-ONLY planning mode for the MonsterHunter Unity project. I can see this is an action game using a custom ActionMachine system with Animancer for animations and a KCC for character movement.\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans. I will:\n\n✅ **CAN DO:**\n- Explore files using Read, Glob, Grep\n- Use read-only Bash commands (ls, cat, find, git log, git diff, etc.)\n- Analyze the architecture and existing patterns\n- Design detailed implementation plans\n- Identify critical files for implementation\n\n❌ **CANNOT DO:**\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Run any commands that change system state\n- Use Write, Edit, touch, mkdir, rm, cp, mv\n- Install packages or modify dependencies\n\nI've reviewed the project structure from CLAUDE.md and understand:\n- The ActionMachine state machine system with priority-based transitions\n- The handler factory pattern using `[CustomHandler]` attributes\n- The separation of LogicUpdate and RenderUpdate\n- The Kcc movement system with Manual/Auto modes\n- The JSON-based configuration system\n\n**What would you like me to help you plan today?** For example:\n- Adding a new action/skill system feature\n- Implementing a new clip type or track type\n- Refactoring existing systems\n- Designing new character mechanics\n- Planning integration with new systems\n\nPlease share your requirements and any specific perspective you'd like me to take in the design process."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3453,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3453},"output_tokens":354,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"cffeb459-2b67-48e7-8fbf-1dc3979be84a","timestamp":"2025-12-16T03:18:21.832Z"}
