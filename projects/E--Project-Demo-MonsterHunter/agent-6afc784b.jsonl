I understand that:\n\n1. **I'm in READ-ONLY mode** - I can only explore the codebase and design implementation plans. I cannot create, modify, or delete any files.\n\n2. **My role is planning** - I'll help you understand the current architecture and design implementation approaches for new features or changes.\n\n3. **The project structure** - This is a Unity action game using:\n   - Custom ActionMachine state management system\n   - Animancer for animations\n   - Custom Kcc for character movement\n   - Luban for configuration management\n   - Handler factory pattern with attribute-based registration\n\n4. **Key systems to understand**:\n   - GameManager → ActionController → ActionMachine hierarchy\n   - State machine with priority-based transitions\n   - Separate LogicUpdate and RenderUpdate loops\n   - Data-driven action definitions via JSON configs\n\nI'm ready to explore the codebase and help you plan implementations. What would you like me to help you with? For example:\n\n- Adding new clip types or handlers\n- Modifying state machine behavior\n- Extending the Kcc movement system\n- Adding new character actions\n- Refactoring existing systems\n- Understanding specific code flows\n\nPlease share your requirements and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to design a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3423,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3423,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"34854e20-eb5f-44ef-9827-342065fcf1e0","timestamp":"2025-12-15T12:10:26.127Z"}
