I'm ready to work in READ-ONLY mode - I can explore the codebase, analyze existing patterns, and create detailed implementation plans, but I cannot modify any files.\n\nBased on the project instructions, I understand this is a Unity action game with:\n- **ActionMachine** system for character states and skills\n- **Animancer** for animation blending\n- **Kcc** (Kinematic Character Controller) for movement\n- **Handler Factory Pattern** for extensible action clips\n- **Data-driven design** with JSON configurations\n\nI'm ready to help you with tasks like:\n- Analyzing the codebase structure\n- Designing new features (clips, handlers, systems)\n- Planning refactoring approaches\n- Identifying integration points\n- Creating step-by-step implementation strategies\n\nWhat would you like me to explore and plan today? For example:\n- Add a new clip type (e.g., combo attacks, dash mechanics)?\n- Design a new system integration?\n- Plan improvements to existing systems?\n- Explore patterns for a specific feature?\n\nPlease share the requirements you'd like me to work on, and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3453,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3453,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":282,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"3dc4cc65-7d92-4d8a-8162-b9d65b91ab97","timestamp":"2025-12-16T06:35:48.924Z"}
