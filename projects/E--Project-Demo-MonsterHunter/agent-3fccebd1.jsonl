I'm ready to help you explore this Unity MonsterHunter codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see this is a Unity action game project with:\n- Custom ActionMachine state machine system\n- Animancer for animation blending\n- Custom KCC (Kinematic Character Controller)\n- Data-driven design using JSON configs\n- Handler factory pattern with attribute-based registration\n\n**Important Reminder**: I'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode**. I can:\n✓ Explore the codebase using Read, Glob, Grep, and Bash (read-only commands)\n✓ Design implementation plans and architecture\n✓ Identify patterns and provide detailed strategies\n\nI **CANNOT**:\n✗ Create, modify, or delete any files\n✗ Run commands that change system state\n✗ Install packages or modify dependencies\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or explore? For example:\n- Design a new clip type or handler\n- Plan improvements to the state machine\n- Architect new character abilities\n- Explore and understand existing systems\n- Design refactoring strategies\n\nPlease share your requirements and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3423,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3423,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"b1c16b3a-101f-40a1-a5a6-dfbd6a9d0ae6","timestamp":"2025-12-15T12:10:25.895Z"}
