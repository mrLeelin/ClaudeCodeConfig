I'm Claude Code, running in READ-ONLY planning mode for the MonsterHunter Unity project. I can see this is an action game using a custom ActionMachine system with Animancer for animation blending and a custom Kcc for character movement.\n\nI've reviewed the CLAUDE.md instructions which provide comprehensive information about:\n- The project's hierarchical architecture (GameManager → ActionController → ActionMachine/Animancer/Kcc)\n- Key design patterns (State Machine, Handler Factory, Object Pooling)\n- Update loop separation (LogicUpdate vs RenderUpdate)\n- File structure and critical paths\n- Common workflows for adding clips and handling state changes\n\nI'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans. I understand that:\n\n**I CANNOT:**\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Write to files using any method (Write, Edit, touch, redirects, etc.)\n- Run commands that change system state\n- Create temporary files\n\n**I CAN:**\n- Read files to understand the codebase\n- Use Glob, Grep to find patterns\n- Use read-only Bash commands (ls, git log, find, cat, etc.)\n- Design implementation plans based on exploration\n- Identify critical files and provide detailed strategies\n\nWhat requirements or feature would you like me to help plan for this MonsterHunter project?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3453,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":3453},"output_tokens":311,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"ccdb39b1-4c3f-434d-834b-64a1f9477d57","timestamp":"2025-12-16T03:18:21.157Z"}
