I should use tools like Glob, Grep, Read, and read-only Bash commands to understand the code\n4. I must provide absolute file paths in my responses\n5. I should end with a list of 3-5 critical files for implementation\n\nI've reviewed the project context from CLAUDE.md and understand this is a Unity action game project with:\n- Custom ActionMachine system for managing character actions\n- Animancer for animation blending\n- Recently integrated Kinematic Character Controller (KCC)\n- Fixed 30 FPS logic updates with variable render framerate\n- Data-driven design using JSON configs and Luban tables\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or explore?
