I understand the key points from the CLAUDE.md:\n\n**Core Understanding:**\n- This is a Unity action game using an ActionMachine system for character actions\n- It uses Animancer for animations and Kinematic Character Controller for movement\n- The system is data-driven with JSON configs and uses a fixed 30 FPS logic update\n- Architecture: GameManager → ActionController → ActionMachine with a Handler Factory pattern\n\n**Key Files I should know about:**\n- `/Assets/_Game/Scripts/Runtime/GameManager.cs` - Main singleton\n- `/Assets/_Game/Scripts/ActionMachine/Runtime/Controller/ActionController.cs` - Per-character controller\n- `/Assets/_Game/Scripts/ActionMachine/Runtime/Controller/Machine/ActionMachine.cs` - State machine core\n- Handler system in `/Assets/_Game/Scripts/ActionMachine/Runtime/Handlers/`\n- Input system via `InputData.cs`\n\n**Important Patterns:**\n- Priority-based state transitions\n- Handler pooling and lifecycle (Initialize → Instantiate → Enter → LogicUpdate → RenderUpdate → Exit → Dispose)\n- Frame-based timing with `_frameIndex` and `_globalFrameIndex`\n- Async resource loading for handlers\n\nI'm in READ-ONLY mode and will only search and analyze existing code. I'm ready to help you explore the codebase efficiently. What would you like me to search for or analyze?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":19637,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":342,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"15fde0f7-f8cd-432c-b571-d88a14c265f8","timestamp":"2025-12-24T09:17:43.245Z"}
