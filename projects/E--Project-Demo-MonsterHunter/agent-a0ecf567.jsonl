I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore this MonsterHunter Unity project codebase and create implementation plans.\n\nI can see this is a Unity action game with a custom ActionMachine system, Animancer integration, and a KCC (Kinematic Character Controller). The project uses:\n\n- A state machine pattern for character actions\n- Handler factory pattern with attributes\n- Object pooling for handlers\n- Data-driven design with JSON configs\n- Separation of logic and render updates\n\n**I am in READ-ONLY mode** - I can only:\n- Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read\n- Use read-only Bash commands (ls, cat, git log, find, etc.)\n- Design implementation plans\n- Identify critical files\n\n**I cannot**:\n- Create, edit, or delete any files\n- Run commands that modify system state\n- Use Write, Edit, or any file modification operations\n\nWhat would you like me to help you with? For example:\n- Explore a specific system or feature\n- Design a plan for adding new functionality\n- Analyze existing patterns and architecture\n- Create an implementation strategy for a requirement\n\nPlease share your requirements and any perspective you'd like me to apply during the design process."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":3453,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"a82dee35-9825-4a42-a531-b6180184be05","timestamp":"2025-12-16T06:36:11.114Z"}
