Let me start by understanding the current structure and any specific requirements you have.\n\nLooking at the git status, I can see there have been significant changes, particularly the removal of the ExplosiveLLC RPG Character animation pack and modifications to Claude settings.\n\nBased on the CLAUDE.md documentation, this is a MonsterHunter action game project with:\n\n1. **Core Architecture**: ActionMachine system for state management, Animancer for animations, and Kinematic Character Controller (KCC) for movement\n2. **Key Systems**: GameManager, ActionController, ActionMachine, InputData\n3. **Recent Changes**: KCC integration, logic update refactor to 30 FPS fixed timestep\n\nBefore I proceed with exploration and planning, I need to understand:\n\n**What specific feature or improvement would you like me to plan for?**\n\nFor example:\n- Integrating the new KCC system with ActionController (noted as TODO in the docs)\n- Adding new character actions/skills\n- Improving the animation system\n- Implementing combat mechanics\n- Adding new clip types for the ActionMachine\n- Performance optimizations\n- Something else entirely\n\nOnce you provide the requirements, I'll thoroughly explore the relevant parts of the codebase and design a detailed implementation plan following the existing patterns and architecture."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":19767,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":19767,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":300,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"f65de761-ae2e-420a-b815-63f5075e3834","timestamp":"2025-12-24T11:25:40.174Z"}
