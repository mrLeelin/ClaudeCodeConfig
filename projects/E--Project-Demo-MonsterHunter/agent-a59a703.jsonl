I'm in READ-ONLY mode, so I can only explore files and create plans - I cannot modify any files.\n\nLet me start by understanding what you'd like me to work on. Based on the project structure from the CLAUDE.md documentation, I can see this is a Unity action game project with:\n\n- **ActionMachine** system for character state management\n- **Kcc** (Kinematic Character Controller) for movement\n- **Handler** system for processing game actions\n- **Animancer** integration for animations\n- **Luban** configuration system\n\nI'm ready to help with:\n1. **Architecture Exploration** - Understanding existing patterns and systems\n2. **Feature Planning** - Designing new features or improvements\n3. **Code Analysis** - Investigating specific components or flows\n4. **Refactoring Plans** - Proposing structural improvements\n\nWhat specific task or feature would you like me to explore and plan for? Please provide:\n- The requirements or feature description\n- Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take (e.g., performance optimization, code organization, new gameplay feature, etc.)\n- Any relevant files or areas of the codebase I should focus on\n\nOnce you provide the requirements, I'll thoroughly explore the codebase using Read, Grep, and Glob commands, then deliver a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":10337,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":10337,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":320,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"fce7f0f3-8815-4e8a-b182-27265d8efe54","timestamp":"2025-12-15T09:53:26.592Z"}
