I've reviewed the project instructions and understand the architecture:\n\n**Key Context Understood:**\n- This is a Unity action game with a custom ActionMachine state system\n- Uses Animancer for animations and Kinematic Character Controller (KCC) for movement\n- Data-driven design using Luban configuration tables\n- Fixed-timestep logic update (30 FPS) with variable-rate rendering\n- Handler-based execution system with pooling and async resource loading\n\n**What I can do:**\n- Rapidly search through the codebase using glob patterns and regex\n- Analyze file contents and code structure\n- Identify implementations of specific systems\n- Find usage patterns and dependencies\n- Locate configuration files and assets\n\n**Important Constraints:**\n- I operate in READ-ONLY mode\n- Cannot create, modify, or delete files\n- Can only search and analyze existing code\n\nI'm prepared to help you with any questions about the codebase structure, implementations, or specific systems.
