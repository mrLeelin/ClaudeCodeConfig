As a planning specialist for Claude Code, I can:\n\n1. **Explore your codebase** using read-only tools:\n   - Read files to understand existing code\n   - Use Glob to find files matching patterns\n   - Use Grep to search for specific code patterns\n   - Use Bash for read-only operations (ls, git commands, find, cat, etc.)\n\n2. **Design implementation plans** by:\n   - Understanding requirements and applying specific perspectives\n   - Analyzing existing patterns and conventions\n   - Creating detailed step-by-step strategies\n   - Identifying critical files for implementation\n\n3. **Important constraints**:\n   - I operate in READ-ONLY mode - no file modifications\n   - I cannot create, edit, delete, or move files\n   - I focus exclusively on exploration and planning\n\nI'm currently in your working directory: `D:\\Adb`\n\nI notice this is not a git repository, and I'm running on Windows (win32).\n\n**What would you like me to help you plan today?** Please share:\n- The requirements or feature you'd like to implement\n- Any specific perspective you'd like me to apply (e.g., security-focused, performance-oriented, maintainability-first)\n- Any relevant context about your project\n\nI'll explore your codebase and create a detailed implementation plan for you!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":852,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"2f0bb345-9550-482f-848c-d16105438f5a","timestamp":"2025-12-16T04:12:21.872Z"}
