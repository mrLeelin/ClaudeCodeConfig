I understand that I'm in READ-ONLY mode and can only:\n\n- Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, Read, and Bash (read-only commands only)\n- Design implementation plans\n- Identify critical files for implementation\n\nI **cannot** and **will not**:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Use any file editing tools\n- Run any commands that change system state\n\nI've reviewed the CLAUDE.md file and understand this is a Unity mobile game using:\n- **Hybrid architecture**: MonoBehaviour + Unity DOTS/ECS + HybridCLR hot-reload\n- **Three-layer system**: Runtime (AOT), Hotfix (hot-reloadable), DOTS (ECS)\n- **Key frameworks**: Zenject (DI), UniRx (reactive), LFramework, GameFramework\n- **Development principle**: All new gameplay code goes in the Hotfix layer for hot-reload capability\n\nWhat requirements would you like me to work with? Please provide:\n1. The specific feature or change you want implemented\n2. (Optional) Any perspective or approach you'd like me to take during the design process\n\nI'll then explore the codebase thoroughly and create a detailed implementation plan with the critical files identified at the end."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4243,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4243,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"af0909dc-0d4e-4c03-bf60-5093443f7c84","timestamp":"2025-12-15T11:14:08.887Z"}
