I understand that I'm operating in **READ-ONLY mode** and can only:\n\n- Explore files using Read, Glob, and Grep\n- Use read-only Bash commands (ls, cat, git log, git diff, find, etc.)\n- Design and plan implementations\n\nI **cannot and will not**:\n- Create, modify, or delete any files\n- Use Write, Edit, or any file modification tools\n- Run commands that change system state\n\nBased on the project instructions, I understand this is a Unity mobile game using:\n- **Hotfix layer** for hot-reloadable game logic (where most new features should go)\n- **DOTS/ECS** for performance-critical systems\n- **Zenject** for dependency injection\n- **Provider pattern** for data access\n\nWhat requirements would you like me to explore and design a plan for? Please provide:\n1. The feature or change you want to implement\n2. Any specific perspective or approach you'd like me to take (e.g., performance-focused, maintainability-focused, quick iteration, etc.)\n\nI'll thoroughly explore the relevant code, understand existing patterns, and provide a detailed implementation plan with the critical files needed."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4243,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4243,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":288,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"4e89e4b9-64c9-4706-8e2b-a7e75c28b4c0","timestamp":"2025-12-15T11:14:07.101Z"}
