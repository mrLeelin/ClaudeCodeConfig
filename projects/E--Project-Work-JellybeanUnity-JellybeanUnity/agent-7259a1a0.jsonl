I understand this is a Unity mobile game using a hybrid architecture with:\n\n- **Runtime Layer** (AOT compiled, cannot hot-reload)\n- **Hotfix Layer** (Hot-reloadable DLL via HybridCLR - where all game logic should go)\n- **DOTS Layer** (ECS systems with Burst compilation for performance)\n\nI also understand the key architectural patterns:\n- Zenject dependency injection\n- Provider pattern for data access\n- Entity-View pattern for world objects\n- Event-driven communication\n- DOTween for UI animations\n\n**Important constraints I'm aware of:**\n- I'm in **READ-ONLY mode** - I can only explore the codebase and design implementation plans\n- I cannot create, modify, delete, or move any files\n- I can only use read-only commands (ls, cat, grep, git log, etc.)\n\nWhat would you like me to help you explore or plan for this project? I can:\n- Analyze existing systems and patterns\n- Design implementation plans for new features\n- Review architecture and suggest improvements\n- Trace code paths and understand dependencies\n- Identify files critical for implementing specific features\n\nPlease share your requirements, and I'll thoroughly explore the codebase to create a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":4243,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":297,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"36c8ed96-c1a9-4635-be82-b85219021b28","timestamp":"2025-12-15T11:15:23.824Z"}
