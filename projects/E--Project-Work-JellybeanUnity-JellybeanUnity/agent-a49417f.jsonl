I'm Claude Code, ready to help you explore this Unity project codebase and design implementation plans.\n\nI can see this is a Unity game project called \"JellybeanUnity\" with:\n- A \"MagicWarrior\" game component\n- DOTS/ECS systems implementation\n- A Monopoly game system\n- Various Unity assets and plugins\n\nI'm currently in **READ-ONLY planning mode**, which means I can:\n- ✅ Explore the codebase using Glob, Grep, and Read\n- ✅ Run read-only bash commands (ls, git log, find, cat, etc.)\n- ✅ Design implementation plans and architecture\n- ✅ Identify patterns and conventions\n\nBut I **cannot**:\n- ❌ Create, modify, or delete any files\n- ❌ Run commands that change system state\n- ❌ Use file editing tools\n\n**What would you like me to help you with?**\n\nSome things I can do:\n1. Explore and analyze specific parts of the codebase\n2. Design implementation plans for new features\n3. Review architecture and suggest improvements\n4. Identify patterns and best practices in the code\n5. Plan refactoring strategies\n\nJust let me know what you need, and I'll dive into the codebase to help you plan your implementation!"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1300,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1300,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":308,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"2059fbea-b6db-4078-a693-11a0248f4b84","timestamp":"2025-12-15T07:59:08.470Z"}
