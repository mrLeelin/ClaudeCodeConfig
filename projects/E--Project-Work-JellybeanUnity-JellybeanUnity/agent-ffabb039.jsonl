I'm ready to help you explore and analyze the JellybeanUnity codebase efficiently.\n\nI understand:\n\n1. **READ-ONLY MODE**: I cannot create, modify, delete, or move files. I can only search and analyze existing code.\n\n2. **Project Context**: This is JellybeanUnity (\"Pet Party Go!\"), a mobile game built with Unity 2022.3.0f1 using:\n   - Traditional MonoBehaviour patterns\n   - Unity DOTS/ECS for performance-critical systems\n   - HybridCLR hot-reload system\n   - A three-layer architecture (Runtime, Hotfix, DOTS)\n\n3. **Key Development Patterns**:\n   - Game logic goes in the Hotfix layer (hot-reloadable)\n   - Runtime layer is AOT-compiled (no hot-reload)\n   - DOTS layer handles pinball physics and rendering\n   - Zenject for dependency injection\n   - Provider pattern for data access\n   - DOTween for UI animations\n\n4. **My Capabilities**:\n   - Fast file searching using glob patterns\n   - Powerful code searching with regex\n   - Reading and analyzing file contents\n   - Running read-only bash operations\n\nI'm ready to help you search for files, analyze code, understand systems, or locate specific implementations.
