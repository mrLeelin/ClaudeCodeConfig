This is a mobile game built with Unity 2022.3.0f1 using:\n\n- **Hybrid architecture**: MonoBehaviour + Unity DOTS/ECS + HybridCLR hot-reload\n- **Three-layer system**: Runtime (AOT), Hotfix (hot-reloadable game logic), DOTS (performance-critical)\n- **Key frameworks**: Zenject (DI), UniRx (reactive), UniTask (async), LuBan (config), DOTween (animations)\n- **Main systems**: Home, Monopoly, Battle, Active, WeekActivity, Login, DamageBuilding\n\nI understand the critical constraints:\n\n1. **All new gameplay code must go in the Hotfix layer** for hot-reload capability\n2. **DOTS systems** for performance-critical features (physics, rendering)\n3. **Provider pattern** for data access with DI\n4. **Entity-View pattern** for world objects\n5. **Event system** for communication (GameFramework events + UniRx)\n\nI'm ready to help with:\n- Exploring the codebase (READ-ONLY mode)\n- Designing implementation plans\n- Following existing patterns and conventions\n- Understanding the architecture\n\n**Important**: I'm in READ-ONLY mode - I can only explore and plan, not modify files.\n\nWhat would you like me to help you design or explore in this codebase?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4067,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":4067},"output_tokens":344,"service_tier":"standard"}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"08ebbf08-ff2d-48d3-84ad-1f397ea4e39d","timestamp":"2025-12-15T12:05:31.462Z"}
